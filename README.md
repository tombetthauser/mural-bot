### Use Case
- User has garage door with measured height and width. Image for mural is generated by model with approximate height and width matching. Selects between 'Fit to Width - Center - Clip Top & Bottom' or 'Fit to Height - Center - Clip Left & Right' or 'Contain Image'. Selects outline mode. Exports as PDF, vertical by default. Cuts borders off printed images and uses clear gesso, PVA, wheatpaste etc to adhere onto garage surface. Selects color breakdown to 10 colors and prints color mixing sheet with approximate needed volumes based on surface area and percentage coverage (if possible).

### Functions Needed
- [ ] fix export pdf distortion
- [ ] add center and clip by height / width
- [ ] add color reference sheet pdf print with volumes needed
